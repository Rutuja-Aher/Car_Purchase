# Car Purchase Amount Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks

## Overview
This project aims to predict the purchase amount of a car using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). An ANN is a machine learning model inspired by the human brain's neural networks. By training the model on a dataset of car features and their corresponding purchase amounts, we can make predictions about the price of a car based on its attributes.
